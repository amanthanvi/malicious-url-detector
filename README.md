# Scrutinix

Scrutinix is a FOSS multi-signal URL threat analyzer. Paste a suspicious link
and get a streamed, evidence-first report that combines browser-protection
lists, threat feeds, redirect tracing, DNS and TLS context, registration data,
and ML scoring in one place.

## Why Scrutinix

- Streamed analysis over NDJSON instead of spinner-then-dump results.
- Eight normalized signals on every scan result.
- Batch triage for up to 10 URLs with per-item failure isolation.
- Client-side history with re-scan, search, filters, and CSV/JSON export.
- Privacy-aware defaults: history stays in IndexedDB, and server logs avoid raw
  URL strings.
- Public-facing trust surfaces that explain methodology, caveats, and data
  handling.

## Signals

- `virusTotal`: multi-engine reputation check
- `googleSafeBrowsing`: browser-protection verdicts
- `threatFeeds`: URLhaus plus cached OpenPhish community feed coverage
- `mlEnsemble`: hosted classifier plus local lexical scoring
- `ssl`: certificate validity and trust signals
- `whois`: RDAP-backed registration and age context
- `dns`: record-level infrastructure context
- `redirectChain`: hop-by-hop redirect tracing with resilient certificate
  handling

## Product Surface

- Single-URL scans stream `scan_started`, `signal_result`, `scan_complete`, and
  `scan_error` events.
- Batch scans stream per-URL progress and keep one broken URL from aborting the
  rest of the run.
- Summary and Full Report modes present the same scan at different levels of
  density.
- Share links are client-generated snapshots; they do not create a server-side
  share database.
- `/about` and `/privacy` explain how verdicts are formed and what data stays in
  the browser.

## Run Locally

1. Install dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

2. Copy the example env file and add any provider keys you want to enable.

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

3. Start the app.

```bash
npm run dev
```

For browser automation and local audits, bind the host explicitly:

```bash
npm run dev -- --hostname 127.0.0.1 --port 3000
```

## Environment

Core provider and deployment variables:

```env
VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY=
GOOGLE_SAFE_BROWSING_API_KEY=
HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=
HUGGINGFACE_URL_MODEL=DunnBC22/codebert-base-Malicious_URLs
URLHAUS_AUTH_KEY=
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=
KV_REST_API_URL=
KV_REST_API_TOKEN=
OPENPHISH_FEED_URL=https://openphish.com/feed.txt
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://www.scrutinix.net
```

Scrutinix still runs in a degraded mode without third-party keys. Local
enrichment signals remain available, provider failures are surfaced explicitly,
and safe-result confidence is capped when primary reputation coverage is
missing.

## Quality Bar

Primary local checks:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run format -- --check .
npm run typecheck
npm run test:unit -- --run
npm run test:integration -- --run
npm run test:e2e -- --grep @smoke
npm run build
```

Additional repo maintenance checks:

```bash
npm audit
npm run lighthouse
```

## Architecture

- `app/api/analyze/route.ts`: single-scan NDJSON endpoint
- `app/api/analyze/batch/route.ts`: batch NDJSON endpoint
- `proxy.ts`: request gating and rate limiting for `/api/analyze`
- `lib/server/`: orchestration, provider adapters, caching, logging, and stream
  helpers
- `components/scrutinix/`: branded analyzer UI and client runtime islands
- `hooks/`: NDJSON stream readers and IndexedDB-backed history
- `tests/`: unit, integration, accessibility, keyboard, and E2E smoke coverage
